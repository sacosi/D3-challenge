          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>This chart shows the correlation between health risks and factors such
            as proverty, age and income for each of the 50 states in the United States of America
          </p>

          <p>
            Starting with poverty, it is very clear in this chart that the states where the population is poorer, the
            number of people without healthcare also increases, as expected. With some States as exceptions, the same
            can also be confirmed with the rate of people that smokes and obesity. As easily predicted, but confirmed by
            this data,the states with higher obesity and smoking rates, are the ones with higher levels of poverty.
          </p>

          <p>When looking at how the median age correlates with the health risks, it's not so linear as the poverty.
            However, we can see that the younger the popolation in a state is the more they lack healthcare,
            which could be explained by the struglle a lot of young employees have on finding a first job with helthcare
            insurance. Even though older population have better healthcare, the data shows that they smoke more. So
            summarizing, states with older population have more smokers but also more people with healthcare coverage.
            The obisity rate doesn't seem to be impacted by the age.
          </p>

          <p>Last but not least, the income seems to impact significantly the 3 measures the same way. Basically, the
            lower the median household income is for a state the higher values it has of smokers, obesity and people
            without healthcare.</p>
