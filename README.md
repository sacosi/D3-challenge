# D3-challenge

For this challenge we were given a dataset from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.  it is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: [https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml]

Based on that dataset I was tasked with creating a scatter plot where each point would represent one of the 50 US states and it would be comparing how demographics impact lack of healthcare, obesity and smoking rates. The demographic measures user were poverty, age and household income.

This asssigment enforces the use of the D3 JavaScript library.

Please see the results here: https://sacosi.github.io/D3-challenge/D3_data_journalism/

Under the D3_data_journalism folder you'll find all the relevent files: dataset, css, javascript and html.
